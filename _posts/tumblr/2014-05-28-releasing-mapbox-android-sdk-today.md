I have had the great privilege of getting to work with the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) team and other open source contributors since January on the brand new Mapbox Android SDK.  Today the first supported version was officially released!  While there’s still a lot more to do, it’s an exciting day as it’s now possible to get all the amazing OpenStreetMap powered maps (Satellite, Terrain, Street) on Android as first class citizens.  For more information check out the [blog posting on the release](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/android-sdk/).  Also be sure to check out the [free demo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapbox.mapboxandroiddemo) that’s available on Google Play.

The project is also looking for more developers so if you’re interested you too can participate.  Just check it out on GitHub -> [https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk)
