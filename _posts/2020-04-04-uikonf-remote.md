<!--excerpt.start-->
The organizers of UIKonf just announced that this year's conference will be remote only due to COVID-19 pandemic.  I'm really glad that they did this to help in the fight against this disease while still allowing the conference to continue.  UIKonf has been my favorite tech conference due to it's forward thinking and social nature and this year is shaping up to be no different.
