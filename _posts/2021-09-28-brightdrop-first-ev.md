_BrightDrop Completes Record-Setting Build of its First Electric Light Commercial Vehicle; Unveils New Vehicle and Inks Deal with Verizon_
 <!--excerpt.end-->

I had the great priviledge to join [BrightDrop](https://www.gobrightdrop.com) this past April to work on electrifying the delivery and logistics sector.  Being part of the team that is bringing vehicles, tools, and services to the market that give commercial delivery and logistics vendors the ability to choose solutions that take diesel burning vehicles off the roads and reduce operating costs while doing so has been truly amazing.

[Today's announcements](https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/sep/0928-brightdrop.html) of the record-setting time build out of BrightDrop's first delivery vehicle, the EV600, and the new EV410 vehicle that Verizon will be using are just some of the amazing things we're working on.
