I'm excited to launch the next interation of my personal Web site today.  It brings back complete control over the content and design which will allow me to hopefully produce richer and more useful content.  I've also ported my site's previous posts going back to 2012 so everything can be found on the same site.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have creating it.

For those curious about the technical specs, it's static site built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and a self customized version of the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.  Finally, it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
