<!--excerpt.start-->
This is my latest personal project called FC Finder.  It uses the [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) API to map out locations of different football clubs (aka soccer teams) around the world.  It also recommends pubs near by each stadium so one can find a good spot to enjoy a pint before and after a match.  If your not sure what beer to have the app will also show you what the local favorites are thanks to [Untappd](https://untappd.com/).
