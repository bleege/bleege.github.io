<!--excerpt.start-->
Earlier this month I had the great fortune to officially [join the Mapbox team](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/welcome-brad-leege/).  Mapbox is an amazing [team of people](https://www.mapbox.com/about/team/) who build tools to allow everyone to create their own custom designed maps for the Web, mobile devices, or even a [canvas print for your wall](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mapbox/15487353502/)!

Mapbox at its core truly values and actively contributes not only to Open Source software but Open Data.  The maps are all powered by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), which is like the Wikipedia for maps and geo data.  This data is all freely available to everyone in the world and even more importantly can be contributed to by anyone in a transparent way.  The software tools are also available on the [Mapbox GitHub site](https://github.com/mapbox/) for anyone to use and contribute to.

I know it’s cliche to say things like this, but as amazing as the technology is the people and culture there are even better.  I’ve never worked with an organization that truly values transparency and teamwork across the entire organization the way Mapbox does.  No matter how small the detail or process, everything is setup and run in a way to promote collaboration, personal empowerment / growth, and trust.  Mapbox truly walks the talk and I couldn’t be happier to work with people like this.
