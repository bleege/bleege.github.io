_tl;dr: Apple accepts location data edits and additions for Apple Maps via macOS Maps app._

<!--excerpt.start-->
As a traveler one of my favorite features about macOS Photos app is the map view that displays the location of each of my photos.  I love how this helps me remember my past travels as well as provides inspiration for places I have yet to visit.  Recently I've digitized some travel photos that were originally taken on film and did not have geolocation information needed to power the map display.  In order to get these photos on the map I had to geocode each photo.  In addition to helping me relive these past trips it also showed me several locations that Apple Maps didn't currently have.  While I was able to use raw latitude / longitude coordinates for my photos the map is much richer for me and for everyone to have the locations labeled.  Thankfully Apple has a way to do this.
