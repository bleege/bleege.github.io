Community Partnership Award
On Wednesday night (12-Dec-2012) I was honored to receive a Community Partnership Award from the City of Madison’s Transit and Parking Commission for my work on making Madison Metro’s transit data available via Mobile UW.  This has helped increase ridership not only for the UW community but also the entire city of Madison.  Metro also credits this work for helping them win the 2012 APTA Award for the Best Transit System of its size in North America.
The success of Mobile UW in this space wouldn’t have been possible without the great work of my fellow recipient and friend Greg Tracy for his SMSMyBus real time data service.
