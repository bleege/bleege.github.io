_I'm immensely proud of building something that helped people for such a long time._
<!--excerpt.end-->

In a tech world that's always hyping and promoting the "next big thing" it's really cool when an opportunity to [celebrate something that has successfully served people for a significant period of time](https://it.wisc.edu/news/uw-madison-retires-wisconsin-mobile-app/).  On a personal level it's also gratifying to know that decisions you helped make, both [technical](/2014/01/30/moving-to-a-reactive-data-server.html) and [feature](/2013/01/18/mobile-uw-15-released-last-night-we-released.html), were correct and proved valuable for the people who used the apps.

Congratulations to the team at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) and specifically John Krogman, Kathy Christoph, Hideko Mills, Nick Weaver, Dave Schroeder, and John Lucas for making Mobile UW (aka Wisconsin App) happen.
