On Wednesday night (12-Dec-2012) I was honored to receive a Community Partnership Award from the [City of Madison’s](http://www.cityofmadison.com/) Transit and Parking Commission for my work on making [Madison Metro’s](http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/) transit data available via [Mobile UW](http://mobile.wisc.edu).  This has helped increase ridership not only for the UW community but also the entire city of Madison.  Metro also credits this work for helping them win the [2012 APTA Award for the Best Transit System of its size in North America](http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/award/index.cfm).

The success of Mobile UW in this space wouldn’t have been possible without the great work of my fellow recipient and friend [Greg Tracy](http://twitter.com/gregtracy) for his SMSMyBus real time data service.
