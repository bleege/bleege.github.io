Iâ€™m really excited about the UW DevBlog launching yesterday.  We built it to help disseminate different ideas, experiences, and best practices for Web and Mobile development across the highly fragmented and decentralized UW-Madison campus community.  Ultimately we hope to open it up so that it will be completely community generated.

The blog was built using Jekyll and Markdown.  We choose these tools because they are key components in our development process and because they work well in community development projects where people have a variety of skill sets.

A big congrats to the team for working across campus boundaries, persevering through some roadblocks, and making this happen.
