Today I’m releasing an updated design to my Web site.  This new design provides a cleaner and more consistent UI design while also making it easier to find content by tag as well as share it via the various platforms.

This past week The Economist published an article, “The battle for territory in digital cartography” by Hal Hodson, discussing how companies like Mapbox and Mapillary are using community powered data from OpenStreetMap, crowdsourced imagery, and anonymous real time GPS location data gathering from smartphones to compete with the likes of Google in the quest to develop autonomous vehicles.

I’m excited to launch the next interation of my personal Web site today.  It brings back complete control over the content and design which will allow me to hopefully produce richer and more useful content.  I’ve also ported my site’s previous posts going back to 2012 so everything can be found on the same site.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have creating it.

Come join us next week at Science Hall on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus as I team up my fellow Mapbox Badger alums and friends to present a hands-on workshop about working with open source geography tools.  We’ll be covering a range of topics from OpenStreetMap, Javascript and the Web, building Mobile apps, and working with PostGIS.  Please bring questions and a laptop.  I look forward to seeing you there!

Making a travel map using Mapbox Studio is incredibly fun and surprisingly quick to do.  I was able to create this map in less than 2 hours this afternoon by tweaking the stock Mapbox Dark style to remove visual clutter (Roads, City Names, Buildings, etc).  From there I uploaded a GeoJSON file that contained the US States outlines and names.  To finish it off I used the built it Data Filter tool to select the states that I’ve visited in order to color them blue.  To explore the map yourself it’s availalble at:

Earlier this month we released Android wrapper libraries for the Mapbox Geocoding and Directions API services to make adding Geocoding and Directions in your Android apps much easier.  Naturally I wanted to do just that so I built a demo app called Go Where I Say that uses Android’s stock Speech To Text API to generate Directions based on voice commands. Did I mention that Google Play Services is NOT required?  In other words it’s not only possible but it’s super easy to ask Mapbox for AND get directions to locations by using your voice inside your own apps without having to (rely on or) say “Hey Siri” or “Ok Google”.  Checkout out the source code to see for yourself how to add this to your own apps.

This past week I was excited to celebrate my first anniversary as a full time member of Mapbox!  It’s been a fantastic experience where I’ve been able to learn many new things and gotten to explore cities that I previously hadn’t spent much time in.  My favorite part by far though has been getting to meet and more importantly getting to know a great group of people.  This is simulateously the  most empathetic, good humored, and smartest group of people that I’ve ever worked with.  It’s the combination of these traits that makes possible what we have been able to achieve together.

Mapbox is a flat, decentralized organization with no org chart nor officially defined responsbilities.  It’s also made up of team members distributed across the globe with roughly equal numbers working in 1 of 4 physical offices as well as remotely from home offices.  To many people this type of environment may seem like chaos and impossible to build anything, none the less actually ship a major product.  I disagree.  Mapbox Mobile could only have been built in this environment.

This week’s official launch of Mapbox Mobile was the culmination of a lot of hard wark done by a dedicated team of people distributed around the globe.  The end product is amazing (seriously you gotta play with this) with an equally impressive tech list, but the real story is how we pulled this all off working together as a unified team.
