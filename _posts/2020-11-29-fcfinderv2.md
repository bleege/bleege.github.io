A combination of events earlier this year led me to my most recent side project, FC Finder V2.  Specificaly, I'd been wanting to explore [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) for myself as well as start learning [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/), especailly after Apple announced it's second rev at WWDC in June.  My problem was that I couldn't decide on a good way to do so until the timly combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and the deprecation of [Mapbox Classic Map Styles](https://blog.mapbox.com/deprecating-studio-classic-styles-d8892ac38cb4).  The pandemic shutdown all TV with only soccer leagues coming back and I wanted to learn more about these places.
