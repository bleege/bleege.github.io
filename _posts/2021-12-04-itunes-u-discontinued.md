[iTunes U](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/itunes-u/id490217893) is a course management sytem designed to enable instructors to manage their courses and students to learn on-the-go via Apple's market leading mobile device, the iPod.  Its original innovation was to support distribution of course documents, audio / visual materials, course lectures, and podcasting.  It is used around the world at such institutions as Stanford, Duke, UC Berkeley Harvard, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  After 14 years [Apple is now discontinuing iTunes U](https://support.apple.com/guide/itunesu/welcome/web) at the end of the year.

iTunes U was developed in 2006-7 as a collaboration between Apple and four leading universities (Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, and Brown).  [Jan Cheetham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jancheetham/) and I represented the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) focusing on podcasting.  At the time, [podcasting was an emerging technology](https://www.wired.com/2005/03/curry/) and the iPhone hadn't been released yet.

Congratulations to [Jason Ediger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonediger/), [Eric Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbailey3/), [Charles d'Harcourt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesdharcourt/) and everyone on the team for developing such a long lasting and impactful product.
