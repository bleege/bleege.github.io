This past week [Hal Hodson](https://twitter.com/halhod) at [The Economist](http://www.economist.com) published an article, ["The battle for territory in digital cartography"](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21723173-not-all-roads-lead-google-maps-battle-territory-digital-cartography), discussing how companies like [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com) are using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) to compete with the likes of Google in the quest to develop autonomous vehicles.
