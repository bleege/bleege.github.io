<p>This past week I was excited to celebrate my first anniversary as a full time member of <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>!  It’s been a fantastic experience where I’ve been able to learn many new things and gotten to explore cities that I previously hadn’t spent much time in.  My favorite part by far though has been getting to meet and more importantly getting to know a great group of people.  This is simulateously the  most empathetic, good humored, and smartest group of people that I’ve ever worked with.

<p>Speaking of which, it’s hard to believe but in just this one year we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built and released mobile vector mapping SDKs for <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-mobile/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-mobile-android/">Android</a></li>
  <li>Released <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/announcing-mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a> for WYSIWYG vector map styling and design</li>
  <li>Grew the mobile team from 3 to 8 people</li>
  <li>Partnered with Twitter <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/custom-maps-with-twitter-fabric/">on Twitter Fabric</a></li>
  <li>Partnered with NVIDIA to use the Mapbox Android SDK in their <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/01/04/drive-px-ces-recap/">DRIVE PX 2 platform announced at CES 2016</a></li>
  <li>Supported Nepal Earthqauke Relief <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapping-nepal/">crisis mapping</a> and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/hot-nepal-fundraiser/">fundraising</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, it couldn’t have gone better from my perspective.  I’m incredibly grateful to be part of this team and to the people who helped get me here.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what we do together this year!</p>
