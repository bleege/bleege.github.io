[Wisconsin Sees Fewer Miles Driven Every Year Since 2004](http://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-sees-fewer-miles-driven-every-year-2004)

> A newly-released study shows that Wisconsin residents have driven fewer miles in their cars

I woke up this morning to this story on Wisconsin Public Radio about how we seem to be driving less in Wisconsin these days (which is awesome IMHO).  It got even better on a personal level when one of the reasons given for this trend was from Madison Metro Transit saying that ridership numbers continue to go up due to mobile apps like [Mobile UW](https://mobile.wisc.edu/) helping take “a lot of the apprehension out of riding the bus.”  Yay!
