_U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere is the ultimate expression of what's possible at the Intersection of Liberal Arts & Technology._
<!--excerpt.end-->

I was fortunate to to attend [U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere](https://www.thespherevegas.com/shows/u2) on December 1st and was overwhelmed by the experience.  The sheer scale of the audio and visual presentations left me physically disoriented for an hour or so after the show.  It truly was a one of a kind experience.

Processing things the next day all I could think about was [Steve Jobs's famous quote]( https://hbr.org/2011/08/steve-jobss-ultimate-lesson-fo):

> “Technology alone is not enough. It’s technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing.

It's the alchemy of these two components, U2 and Sphere, that produces something so magical and greater than the sum of their parts.  On it's own [Sphere](https://www.thespherevegas.com) is truly an engineering marvel, but ultimatley it's just a $2 Billion large metallic dome.  To truly realize and surpass it's potential it is dependent upon the creativity of artists.  This is where [U2](https://www.u2.com) and their production team deliver with aplomb.  Long regarded as the one of the best live bands in the world, even U2 had to push themselves past their creative limits to truly produce a show of this scale.

Ultimately no amount of words, photos, nor videos can truly convey what this particular show is all about... it has to be experienced live and in person.  Thankfully U2 [just extended their run until March 2, 2024](https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/u2-las-vegas-residency-sphere-tickets-1235328384/) and I highly recommend going if you can.
