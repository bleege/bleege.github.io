I got my shiny “Statement of Accomplishment” (with Distinction !) PDF the other day from Coursera for successfully completing Roger Peng’s (Johns Hopkins University) “Computing For Data Analysis” course.  The course is about using the R statistical programming language to load, analyze, and graph data.  It was a nice formal introduction to R, but after working with it I can definitely see why R is not necessarily the preferred choice among software engineers for analyzing data.  Regardless if you’re looking for a way to learn more about data analysis or see the topic from a different perspective I’d recommend the course.
