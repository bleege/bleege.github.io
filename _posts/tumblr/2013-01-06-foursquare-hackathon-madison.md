<!--excerpt.start-->
I had the great pleasure of participating in the [Foursquare Hackathon 2013](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/foursquare-hackathon-2013) yesterday.  It was a fun opportunity to meet other developers as well as non developers in the Madison area who are interested in building new products / services, social media, geography, and entrepreneurship.

On the technical side it provided (yet) another reason to find a way to make use of the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/).  While many people still think of Foursquare only as “the check in app” (including a large portion of the people who attended the Hackathon yesterday) I really love it’s vast venue data set as well as the opportunities to bring people together socially and geographically.  The Hackathon was also a great way to share tech knowledge and get to work with things that I don’t normally get to at my day job.  A great example for me was getting to build the server API for my team’s project in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  Every time I use Node.js it still _feels_ weird writing JavaScript for the server but it turned out to be the fastest way to get our API built as well as a good way for me (Java background) and my teammate (.NET background) to be able to work together.

Finally, I’d like to thank the crew at [SnowShoe Stamp](http://www.snowshoestamp.com) for hosting the Madison meet up.  They provided a cool workspace, coffee, and beer… everything that a successful hackathon needs!  They’re a great group of people that have got an amazing product that has so many potential uses.
