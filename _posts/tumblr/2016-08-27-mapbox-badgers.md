Come join us next week at Science Hall on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus as I team up my fellow Mapbox Badger alums and friends to present a hands-on workshop about working with open source geography tools.  Weâ€™ll be covering a range of topics from OpenStreetMap, Javascript and the Web, building Mobile apps, and working with PostGIS.  Please bring questions and a laptop.  I look forward to seeing you there!

On Wisconsin!
