Making a travel map using [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) is incredibly fun and surprisingly quick to do.  I was able to create this map in less than 2 hours this afternoon by tweaking the stock Mapbox Dark style to remove visual clutter (Roads, City Names, Buildings, etc).  From there I uploaded a GeoJSON file that contained the US States outlines and names.  To finish it off I used the built it Data Filter tool to select the states that I’ve visited in order to color them blue.  To explore the map yourself it’s availalble at:

If you’re interested in making your own maps like this checkout the [“Make a choropleth map with Mapbox part 1: create a style with Mapbox Studio”](https://www.mapbox.com/help/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/) step by step tutorial.  It provides a great intoduction to the power and simplicity of the Mapbox Studio platform.

Happy Mapping!
