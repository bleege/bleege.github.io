<!--excerpt.start-->
Come join us next week at Science Hall on the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) campus as I team up my fellow [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) Badger alums and friends to present a hands-on workshop about working with open source geography tools.  Weâ€™ll be covering a range of topics from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), Javascript and the Web, building Mobile apps, and working with PostGIS.  Please bring questions and a laptop.  I look forward to seeing you there!
