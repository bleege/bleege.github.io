_tl;dr: A collection of my favorite presentations from UIKonf, an independent technical and community conference for iOS developers._

<!--excerpt.start-->
I had the great pleasure to attend [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) in Berlin, Germany last week.  It was a single track conference over two days that had a great balance of technical, business, and socially positive presentations.  I really enjoyed getting to meet and learn from some incredible people from around the world.  Here are some of my favorite presentations:
