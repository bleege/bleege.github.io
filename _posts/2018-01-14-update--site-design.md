<!--excerpt.start-->
Today I'm releasing an updated design to my Web site.  This new design provides a cleaner and more consistent UI design while also making it easier to find content by tag as well as share it via the various platforms.

Having a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered Web site made this process much easier as it has an amazing community of people and tools surrounding it.  Thanks to this communinty I was able to find a new theme, [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper), improved SEO support via the [Jekyll-SEO plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag), and most importantly a wealth of information on the Web from other people to help learn how to customize things to my exact needs.  Thanks also to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for continuing to host this site.
