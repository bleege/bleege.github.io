<!--excerpt.start-->
I attended the [DotSwift conference](https://2019.dotswift.io/) in Paris, France the last week of January.  It's an afternoon of a series of 18 minute talks and 5 "lightning talks" that last 4 minutes all on topics related to Swift software development.  This conference brings together people from across Europe and North America and emphasizes presence / social interaction.  In fact one of my favorite things about the conferece was it's "No Wifi" policy.  This encouraged attendees and presenters to talk with each other during breaks as well as enable attendees to give their full attention to the presentations.
