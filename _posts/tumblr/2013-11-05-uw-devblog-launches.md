<!--excerpt.start-->
Iâ€™m really excited about the [UW DevBlog](http://devblog.uc.wisc.edu/) launching yesterday.  We built it to help disseminate different ideas, experiences, and best practices for Web and Mobile development across the highly fragmented and decentralized [UW-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/) campus community.  Ultimately we hope to open it up so that it will be completely community generated.

The blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  We choose these tools because they are key components in our development process and because they work well in community development projects where people have a variety of skill sets.

A big congrats to the team for working across campus boundaries, persevering through some roadblocks, and making this happen.
