This past week [The Economist](http://www.economist.com) published an article, ["The battle for territory in digital cartography"](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21723173-not-all-roads-lead-google-maps-battle-territory-digital-cartography) by [Hal Hodson](https://twitter.com/halhod), discussing how companies like [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com) are using community powered data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), crowdsourced imagery, and [anonymous real time GPS location data gathering from smartphones](https://www.mapbox.com/telemetry/) to compete with the likes of Google in the quest to develop autonomous vehicles.

I'm absolutely thrilled to see how my work at Mapbox building the anonymous real time GPS location data gathering technology in the [Mapbox iOS](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/) and [Android SDKs](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/) continue to power Mapbox's business today as well as set it up for future success.  In addition to this, two major things that I'm also very proud of in regards to this work are that fact the data is _collected anonymously_ and that it's _shared openly_.  Unlike many other tech companies, Mapbox has **no way** to tie collected location data to specific and named people.  This was done on purpose.  This focus on privacy not only helps people feel safe using the technology, but also allows Mapbox to publish / donate this location data to OpenStreetMap so that everyone can benefit with the latest in map data collected from the real world.
