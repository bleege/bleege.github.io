<!--excerpt.start-->
The organizers of [UIKonf](https://uikonf.com) just announced that this year's conference will be remote only due to COVID-19 pandemic.  I'm really glad that they did this to help in the fight against this disease while still allowing the conference to continue.  UIKonf has been my favorite tech conference due to it's forward thinking and social nature and this year is shaping up to be no different.  The best part is now everyone can experience this for themselves for just &euro; 100.

Switching formats is not an easy nor inexpensive task, especially when it occurs a little over a month from dates of the conference (May 17 to May 19).  As such it's very important to the iOS Community, and me personally, that we help the organizers out as best we can so that not only can UIKonf happen in 2020 but that it's also able to survive for future years.  I've been lucky enough to get to know the organizers over the past few years personally and I can understand the pressure they're under.

Here's some options for how you can help:

1. Buy a [Remote Ticket](https://ti.to/uikonf/uikonf-2020) for &euro; 100
1. Make a [Support Donation](https://ti.to/uikonf/uikonf-2020/with/u-uwf4mk1cc) for &euro; 100
1. If you've previously bought a Regular Ticket for &euro; 559 tell the organizers that you'd like to donate the &euro; 459 conversion to Remote Ticket rebate that they're offering.  It's what I've done already and would happily do again.
