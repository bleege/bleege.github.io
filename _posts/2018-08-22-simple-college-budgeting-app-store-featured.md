College is an exciting time that often also comes with many new responsiblities, not the least of which is learning how to manage money.  This can be a scary and difficult life skill to learn, especially with so many other things happening simulataneously.  I'm really excited to see our team's work promoted as a tool for helping college students learn these skills in a safe, straightforward, and simple way.
